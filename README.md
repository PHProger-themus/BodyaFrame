# BodyaFrame PHP Framework (Private)

This MVC framework is used by me only when developing websites. But it's main purpose is practical object. I prefer implementing new features here, refactoring old features.

This framework supports (* - planning):

 - Convenient routing system;
 - Multilingualism;
 - Database working models;
 - Middlewares (although it's rules methods)
 - Powerful validation system: user can add its own validation rules and modify fields' names and rules;
 - Automatic CSS and JS files including system;
 - Safety providing: automatic XSS preventing text escaping, CSRF protection, Content-Security-Policy header support, possibility to restrict using website in <frame> tag, change session name and etc.
 - Logging system (implemented with PSR-3 Standard);
 - Console features: files creating, migrations*, user methods;
 - PHPUnit*;
 - Framework works with Composer.
